<h1 align="center">Deep Learning Assignment</h1>

<p align="center">Welcome to the repository for your Deep Learning assignment. In this project, we explore the exciting world of deep learning and put our engineering skills to the test.</p>

## Project Overview

### [Assignment 1](Deep-Learning/assignment-1/Assignment_1_DeepLearning.ipynb)
- In Assignment 1, we tackle the fascinating task of carpet classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Dive into the world of image recognition as we train and evaluate deep learning models to identify different carpet patterns.

### [Assignment 2](Deep-Learning/assignment-2/Assignment_2_DeepLearning.ipynb)
- Assignment 2 is all about predicting trajectories with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Explore the realm of deep learning applied to graphs as we work on trajectory prediction, a critical task in autonomous systems and robotics.

These assignments offer a hands-on experience in the captivating field of Deep Learning, where we harness the power of neural networks to solve real-world challenges.
